This repository contains some simple apps that integrate with different LLMs.  
The aim is to give anyone a running start playing around with AI features!

## Apps:

- [langchain-ollama-demo](./apps/langchain-ollama-demo/Readme.md)
  - Using langchain and ollama to work with a set fully local llm models.
- [langchain-openai-demo](./apps/langchain-openai-demo/Readme.md)
  - Using langchain with openai to get access to the GPT-4 models (replica of the Ollama example for model comparison).
- [node-openai-assistant-demo](./apps/node-openai-assistant-demo/Readme.md)
  - Using the openai node sdk directly to work with the Assistants concept.
